Recurly PHP Client
==================

The Recurly .NET Client library is an open source library to interact with Recurly's subscription management from your ASP.Net website. The library interacts with Recurly's [REST API](http://support.recurly.com/faqs/api).

** This library is not complete and has not been tested. **

Status
------

The library supports working with Accounts.  That's about it.  This library makes a great starting point for 
working with Recurly's REST API.  Please contribute back if you extend the library further.

Installation
------------

If you already have git, the easiest way to download the Recurly .NET Client is with the git command:

    git clone git://github.com/recurly/recurly-client-net.git /path/to/include/recurly
